\chapter{Motivations for Dark Matter Search}
\label{chapter:two}

This chapter provides an overview of the currently known evidences of the presence of Dark Matter. There have been observations which indicate the presence of Dark Matter but most of these observations have been indirect in nature. These observation are the result of gravitational interaction of the Dark Matter and the astrophysical constructs. So, the motivation behind this research analysis is to find direct evidence for the presence of Dark Matter, it could either be in the form of one or more fundamental particles (which is the hypothesis researched in this thesis) or a completely new phenomenon unexplained by the Standard Model.

This chapter will explain the phenomenon which indicate the presence of Dark Matter. We will be explaining the topics of Galactic rotation curves, Gravitational lensing and Dark Matter seeded galaxy formations.
\section{Why are we searching for Dark Matter?}

\subsection{Galactic Rotation Curves}
Galactic rotation curves are made by calculating the rotational velocity of the stars along the length of the galaxy and measuring the corresponding distance of the star from the center. Figure \ref{ch2:rot_curve} shows that the observed rotation curve for the galaxy Messier 33, which seems to deviate significantly from the theoretical prediction based on the amount of observed luminous matter. One might also find an interesting observation in the tail of rotation curve in Figure  \ref{ch2:rot_curve}. The flat tail distribution is apparently very common in rotation curve of most galaxies regardless of their diverse shapes, sizes and locations as shown in Figure \ref{ch2:rot_curves}. These observations point to the fact that the density profile for a galaxy may be different from the ones in which all mass is concentrated at the center. Modeling of this density profile by using N-body numerical simulation can help us profile shape of dark matter distributions around the galaxies. One such profile is the Novarro-Frenk-White profile (NFW) \cite{ch2:Navarro_1997}, given by the following expression \ref{eq:nfw}.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{crit}} = \frac{\delta_{c}}{\frac{r}{r_{s}} \left(1+ \frac{r}{r_{s}}\right)^{2}}
  %\eta = -\ln\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
  \label{eq:nfw}
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the distance from the center of the galaxy, $\delta_{c}$ is the dimensionless characteristic density, $r_{s}$ is the radius scale and $\rho_{crit}$ = $3H^{2}/8\pi G$ is the critical density for closure.

The discrepancy between the two curves can be accounted for by adding a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy.}

From Figure \ref{ch2:core_cusp} we can see that observations clearly indicate approximately constant dark matter density in the inner parts of the galaxies, while the cosmological numerical simulations indicate a steep power-law like distribution. This deviation in the theoretical predictions is referred to as the $"core-cusp"$ problem \citep{ch2:core-cusp}.
However, the dark matter scientific community seems to have opinions on the reasons for the $"core-cusp"$ problem arising either from incomplete understanding of galaxy core dynamics or experimental limitations in the measurements.

Be that as it may, we can say that dark matter is necessary for the explanation of the velocities in the galactic rotation curves.

\subsection{Gravitational Lensing}
The phenomenon of gravitational lensing is the bending of light when it travels near massive objects like the sun. It is a consequence of Einstein's General theory of Relativity \citep{ch2:relativity} which states that the path of the light is bent by gravity when it travels close to a massive object like the sun. This phenomenon was experimentally observed by Arthur Eddington and Andrew Claude Crommelin and Charles Davidson separately at the island of Principe (West Africa) and Sobral (Brazil). They measured the position of a bright group of stars called Haydes, which at the time of the eclipse were behind the sun and were easier to observe because of their brightness. After analysing the photographs it was observed that the stars behind the sun were indeed visible confirming the Einstein's theory of the curvature of the spacetime and the phenomenon of gravitational lensing.

More ideas that really make this a great paper. Maybe a footnote or two.\footnote{Some peripheral thoughts that belong in a note.}
