\chapter{Statistical Framework of Monotop Analysis}
\label{chapter:five}
This chapter will explain the analysis strategy for the monotop analysis in the leptonic channel
\section{Analysis Strategy}

Great thoughts that further your argument. This includes lots of strong evidence presented throughout several paragraphs, each accompanied by necessary citations.

    \noindent Here is a block quotation---a passage from a text you found insightful and wanted to share with others. Maybe it is from a journal article, website, or book. Irrespective, it should support the argument being made.\footnote{A citation for the quoted material.}

%Maybe a sentence or two that bring the argument and evidence together.\citep{dos_santos_2020}




In this section we will list the datasets that we have analyzed and the trigger selection for extracting potentially new physics phenomenon.
\section{Datasets}
Between 2015 and 2018, a total of 150.26 $fb^{-1}$ of data at center- of-mass energy of 13 TeV was recorded, of which 137.64 $fb^{-1}$ is used in the analysis. This loss in data occurs because of the malfunctioning of sub-detectors at different times of data collection. In order to maintain high quality data set such events from problematic detector parts are discarded.
\section{Triggers}

The choices of triggers determine which events are used in the data
\section{Object Reconstruction}
\subsection{Vertexing and Event Filters}
\subsection{Leptons}
\subsection{Jets}
\subsection{Missing Transverse Energy}


\section{Efficiency Studies}
\subsection{Lepton Identification}
\subsection{High Level Trigger}

\section{Event Selection}
\subsection{Pre-Selection}
\subsection{Background Control Regions}
\subsection{Signal Region}
\subsection{Event Yields}

\section{Background Modelling}
\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
this is very important

\section{Statistical Analysis}
this is very important

More ideas that really make this a great paper. Maybe a footnote or two.\footnote{Some peripheral thoughts that belong in a note.}
